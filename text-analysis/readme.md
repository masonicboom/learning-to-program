# Assignment: Text Analysis


## Part 1: Counting

In The Count of Monte Cristo, what is the most frequently occurring word of 10 letters or more? This assignment will guide you towards answering this question with a large number of small steps in Ruby.

Run the script "tester.rb" at any point to have your progress checked automatically. Do it now. You should see "1.1 FAILED", which tells you it's time to solve problem 1.1.


### 1.1 Data retrieval

Download The Count of Monte Cristo from Project Gutenberg. Put it into this directory and name it "comc.txt".


### 1.2 Conversion to machine-readable form

Create a file named "count.rb". Within that file, define a function named "text" that returns the text of The Count of Monte Cristo in one long string.


### 1.3 Transformation to appropriate data structure

First, read the rest of the problems in this section, but, before attempting them, read http://strugglingwithruby.blogspot.com/2009/05/regular-expressions-in-ruby.html and http://www.regular-expressions.info/ruby.html.

#### 1.3.1

Go to http://www.rubular.com/r/rrOJfHVq7R and change the "COMPLETE ME" text in the "Your regular expression:" field so that the "Match Captures:" section shows exactly three results: *m*, *m*, and *m*. Use exactly one character within the parentheses, e.g. "(;)" (which won't work).

#### 1.3.2

Change the text in the parentheses so the "Match Captures:" section shows exactly one result: *mmm*. Use exactly two characters within the parentheses.

#### 1.3.3

Change the text in the parentheses so the "Match Captures:" section shows exactly five results: *y*, *u*, *m*, *m*, *m*, and *y*. Use exactly two characters within the parentheses.

#### 1.3.4

Change the text in the parentheses so the "Match Captures:" section shows exactly one result: *yummmy*. Use exactly three characters within the parentheses.

#### 1.3.5

Change the text in the parentheses so the "Match Captures:" section shows exactly two results: *"* and *!"*. Use exactly three characters within the parentheses, changing only one from 1.3.4.

#### 1.3.6

Within "count.rb", define a function named "words" that returns an array containing each word in the text of The Count of Monte Cristo, with no non-word characters included.


### 1.4 Generation of statistics

Read http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-4.html.

#### 1.4.1

Launch irb and paste in this text: a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

#### 1.4.2

Print each value in a. Refer to http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html if necessary.

#### 1.4.3

Make an empty hash named h.

#### 1.4.4

Put into h a key for each element in a, with the number 1 as each corresponding value. h should look like this when you're done: *{ 1 => 1, 2 => 1, 3 => 1, 5 => 1, 8 => 1 }*.

#### 1.4.4

Re-initialize h to be an empty hash. Put into h a key for each element in a, with the number of times that element appears in a as the corresponding value. h should look like this when you're done: *{ 1 => 2, 2 => 1, 3 => 1, 5 => 1, 8 => 1 }*.

Reading http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Hash.html#M000718 might clue you in to a clever way to do this. Being clever isn't necessary though.

#### 1.4.5

Within "count.rb", define a function named "count" that returns a hash in which each unique word in The Count of Monte Cristo is a key whose value is set to the number of times that word appears in The Count of Monte Cristo.


### 1.5 Basic statistical analysis

Read the sections on Blocks, Block Arguments, Ranges, Arrays, and Hashes in http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-3.html.

Refer to http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html and http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Hash.html.

#### 1.5.1

Open a terminal and run irb. Enter this text: a = [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]. Write an expression that prints each value in a in order. You should see *1*, *3*, *2*, *4* printed.

#### 1.5.2

Write an expression that prints the first 3 elements of a as an array. You should see *[1, 3, 2]* printed.

#### 1.5.3

Write an expression that prints each value in a, multiplied by 2. You should see *2*, *6*, *4*, *8* printed.

#### 1.5.4

Write an expression that prints the values in a, sorted from least to greatest. You should see *1*, *2*, *3*, *4* printed.

#### 1.5.5

Write an expression that prints the values in a, sorted from greatest to least. You should see *4*, *3*, *2*, *1* printed.

#### 1.5.6

Write an expression that prints the values in a, sorted from least to greatest, then multiplied by 2. You should see *2*, *4*, *6*, *8* printed.

#### 1.5.7

Write an expression that prints the values in a, multiplied by 2, then sorted from least to greatest. The output should be identical to that of 1.5.6.

#### 1.5.8

Enter this text: h = { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 3, 'c' => 2, 'd' => 4 }. Write an expression that prints each key in h. You should see *a*, *b*, *c*, *d* printed.

#### 1.5.9

Write an expression that prints each value in h. You should see *1*, *3*, *2*, *4* printed.

#### 1.5.10

Write an expression that prints each key in h. You should see *a*, *b*, *c*, *d* printed.

##### 1.5.11.1

Assign the value "x" to a variable named "k" and the value "99" to a variable named "v". Form an array with k as the first element and v as the second. Print that "pair" as an array. You should see *['x', 99]* printed.

##### 1.5.11.2

Write an expression that prints each key-value pair in h. You should see something like *['a', 1]*, *['b', 3]*, *['c', 2]*, *['d', 4]* printed.

#### 1.5.12

Write an expression that prints each key-value pair in h, sorted from least to greatest by value. You should see *['a', 1]*, *['c', 2]*, *['b', 3]*, *['d', 4]* printed.

#### 1.5.13

Write an expression that prints each key-value pair in h, sorted from greatest to least by value. You should see *['d', 4]*, *['b', 3]*, *['c', 2]*, *['a', 1]* printed.

#### 1.5.14

Within "count.rb", define a function named "sort" that returns an array in which each element is itself an array--a pair--, having, as the first element, a word from The Count of Monte Cristo and, as the second element, the number of times that word occurs in the book; the array must be sorted from greatest number of word occurrences to least.

#### 1.5.15

Print the first 10 elements returned by the sort function. Note: this problem is not tested by tester.rb, but you should have no problem doing it correctly.


### 1.6 Focused statistical analysis

Read the sections on Method Definitions, Return Values, and Default Values at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Method_Calls#Method_Definitions.

Read section 2 at http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-4.html.

Read the section on Conditional Assignment at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Operators#1._Assignment; this isn't essential, but you might find a use for it.

#### 1.6.1

Launch irb. Define a function "f(x)" that returns x. Run "f(3)"; you should see the output *3*. Run "f()" (no argument); you should receive an error.

#### 1.6.2

Define a function "g(x)", with the argument x having a default value of "nil", that returns x. Run "g(3)"; you should see the output *3*. Run "g()" (no argument); you should see the output *nil*.

#### 1.6.3

Define a function "h(x)", with the argument x having a default value of "nil", that sets x to "undefined" if x is nil, then returns x. Run "g(3)"; you should see the output *3*. Run "g()" (no argument); you should see the output *undefined*.

#### 1.6.4

Within "count.rb", change the sort function so that it has a single argument, "unsorted_count", with a default value of nil. Change the sort function so that, if unsorted_count is nil, its value is set to the return value of the count function. At this point, tester.rb should show *1.5 OK*, as before; if it did before but doesn't now, you screwed something up here.

#### 1.6.5

Back in irb, enter this text: a = [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]. Write an expression that returns an array of all elements in a that are greater than 2. You should see the output *[3, 4]*.

#### 1.6.6

Enter this text: h = { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 3, 'c' => 2, 'd' => 4 }. Write an expression that returns a hash of all key => value mappings in h for which the value is greater than 2. You should see the output *{"b"=>3, "d"=>4}*.

#### 1.6.7

Enter this text: h = { 'ant' => 1, 'bird' => 3, 'chimp' => 2, 'dinosaur' => 4 }. Write an expression that returns a hash of all key => value mappings in h for which the key is greater than 4 characters in length. You should see the output *{"chimp"=>2, "dinosaur"=>4}*.

#### 1.6.8

Within "count.rb", define a function named "filtered_sort" that returns an array in which each element is itself an array--a pair--, having, as the first element, a word from The Count of Monte Cristo and, as the second element, the number of times that word occurs in the book; the array must be sorted from greatest number of word occurrences to least; the array must only include words that are 10 characters or more in length.

#### 1.6.9

Print the first 10 elements returned by the filtered_sort function. Note: this problem is not tested by tester.rb, but you should have no problem doing it correctly.

#### 1.6.10

Read off the answer to the original question of the assignment, using the output of 1.6.8. If tester.rb tells you "1.6 OK", your output in 1.6.8 was correct and you got it right.
